      <h1>Matt Lehrer</h1>
      <p>I live in Seattle with my wonderful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmWJ6EKl5ml/">wife and daughter</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I used to live in New York, and I miss it, but my wife misses it more.</p>
      <p>I love technology and entrepreneurship and the way businesses grow.</p>
      <p>My work has mostly focused on financial strategy, spending a lot of time in spreadsheets and thinking about how
        important compound growth is. My work history is on <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattlehrer/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm really into podcasts and you can listen to my favorite episodes by subscribing to <a
          href="https://echopig.com/rss/matt">this RSS feed</a> in any podcast app.</p>
      <p>I was into <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlehrer">Twitter</a> for a while and now prefer lurking
        on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mattlehrer">Reddit</a>.</p>
      <p>I read a lot of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3744922-matt-lehrer">books</a>, mostly from the <a
          href="https://www.spl.org/">library</a>. If you haven't tried <a href="https://meet.libbyapp.com/">Libby</a>,
        you should.</p>
      <p>I built a bunch of Alexa Skills for client pitches while at <a href="https://www.ipglab.com">IPG Media Lab</a>
        which got me excited about getting
        back into software development. I've since worked on some fun side projects, focusing on backend with Node.</p>
      <p>The one project I've made public is <a href="https://www.echopig.com">Echopig</a>, a service to create a feed
        of
        favorite podcast episodes. You can add to the feed directly from a handful of podcast apps and your friends can
        follow
        your favorites in whatever podcast they use.</p>
      <p>Please say hi by <a href="mailto:matt@mattlehrer.com">email</a>.</p>
